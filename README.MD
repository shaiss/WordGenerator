# Introduction

This script generates random compound words using the NLTK WordNet corpus. The words are chosen from a list of words that start with the letters 's', 'h', 'a', or 'i', and are combined using CamelCase. The letters in the words are then substituted with randomly chosen symbols ('5', '$', '#', '@', '!', or '3'). The resulting compound words are printed to the console and written to a file called 'output.txt'.

# Requirements

# Instructions

1. Install the NLTK library if it is not already installed.
2. Set the number of outputs to generate by modifying the 'num_outputs' variable.
3. Run the script.
4. The generated compound words will be printed to the console and written to 'output.txt'.
